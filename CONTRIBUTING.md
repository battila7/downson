# Contributing

Thanks for taking your time to to create a contribution! However, before contributing, please read the [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

Contributions are basically suggestions that will eventually make their way into the specification (or not). These suggestions can be broken down into two categories:

  * *enhancement/fix* – updates to existing features,
  * *new feature* – completely new things, exactly as you would think.

Both should be created as GitHub Issues.

## Before Creating a Suggestion

Please go through the following, before creating a new issue:

  * Carefully check the exact wording of the specification.
  * Consult the GFM specification.
  * Perform a search through existing issues. If you can find something similar (or even the same), please place a comment on that issue.

## Submitting a Suggestion

An ideal suggestion should include the following:

### Enhancement/Fix

  * The reason behind the suggestion. Try to be as descriptive as you can, and please include examples!
  * The part of the specification to be updated.
  * A description of the enhancement itself.
  * Possibly, a new wording for the specification, which accurately captures the changes.

### New Features

  * The reason behind the suggestion. Try to be as descriptive as you can, and please include examples!
  * A description of the enhancement itself.
  * The actual wording of the new feature to include in the specification.
  * **Types only** - Whether the new type should be a part of the core specification or an extension.
